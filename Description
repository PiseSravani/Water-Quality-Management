Modules Used
Arduino Uno: Acts as the central microcontroller for processing sensor data and communicating with the Blynk app.
pH Sensor: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water, which is critical for determining its chemical composition.
Turbidity Sensor: Assesses the clarity of water by measuring the amount of suspended particles, which can indicate pollution levels.
Blynk App: Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and data visualization of water quality parameters.
Additional Libraries:
Blynk Library: Enables communication between the Arduino and the Blynk app.
Sensor Libraries: Specific libraries for interfacing with the pH and turbidity sensors.

#Setting Up the Arduino and Sensors.
# Code to initialize the sensors and Blynk connection
This section of the code sets up the pH and turbidity sensors and establishes the connection with the Blynk app, allowing data transmission.
#Reading Sensor Data
def read_sensor_data():
    pH_value = read_pH()  # Function to read pH sensor data
    turbidity_value = read_turbidity()  # Function to read turbidity sensor data
    return pH_value, turbidity_value
#This function collects data from the pH and turbidity sensors and returns their values for further processing.
#Sending Data to the Blynk App.
def send_data_to_blynk(pH_value, turbidity_value):
    blynk.virtual_write(V0, pH_value)  # Sending pH value to Blynk
    blynk.virtual_write(V1, turbidity_value)  # Sending turbidity value to Blynk
#In this part, the sensor data is sent to the Blynk app using virtual pins, where users can monitor the readings in real-time.
#Main Function
def main():
    while True:
        pH_value, turbidity_value = read_sensor_data()  # Get the latest readings
        send_data_to_blynk(pH_value, turbidity_value)  # Update Blynk app
        time.sleep(10)  # Wait for 10 seconds before the next reading
The main loop continuously reads sensor data and sends it to the Blynk app at regular intervals (every 10 seconds), allowing for up-to-date monitoring.
#Code Entry Point.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # Run the main function when the script is executed
The Arduino Uno initializes the pH and turbidity sensors and establishes a connection to the Blynk app.
The system continuously reads water quality parameters from the sensors.
The collected data is sent to the Blynk app, allowing users to monitor water quality in real-time.
The loop runs indefinitely, updating the readings every 10 seconds.
The program can be modified to include alerts or notifications for specific threshold levels of pH and turbidity.
